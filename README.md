A project designed around finding the most weight lost due to injuries in any NBA season. This will be displayed by fun graphics. Used as a learning tool to learn MySQL, Ubuntu, web scraping, ect. 

FIRST STAGE:
Pick a website to gather data from. Basketball Reference was chosen and 2 APIs were found. One was used to gather game-to-game data while the other is used to gather players' weight and heights. 

SECOND STAGE:
Upload all data into a MySQL database. The code will create tables based on the year entered.

THIRD STAGE:
Data analysis. This will include creating graphics, finding the solution, and manipulating the data gathered to find other data points.
